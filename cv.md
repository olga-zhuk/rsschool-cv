## Code example: 
### Make a function that does arithmetic! KATA from CODEWARS: Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.
a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

#### The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

```function arithmetic(a, b, operator)
{ switch (operator)
{ case 'add': result1 = a + b; return result1; 
case 'subtract': result2 = a - b; return result2; 
case 'multiply': result3 = a * b; return result3;
case 'divide': result4 = a / b; return result4 } }```
